Here are some observations from this assignment:

The "Chain of Trust" is more than just a concept. I realized I was literally building the chain, file by file. It became clear how the server certificate is trusted because of the intermediate, and the intermediate is trusted because of the root.

I now understand why we use a two-tier CA structure. It's all about security. My Root CA is the ultimate source of trust, which I should keep offline. The Intermediate CA is the one I'd use for the actual work of signing certificates, minimizing risk to the root key.

The configuration files are everything. I learned very quickly that one small typo in the openssl.cnf file could stop the entire process. It's obvious that these files are the blueprint that controls the whole PKI setup.

Being organized is non-negotiable. This assignment forced me to be meticulous. I had to manage the different types of files—private keys, CSRs, and certificates—and I definitely won't forget the importance of setting strict permissions like chmod 400 on the private keys.

OpenSSL acts like a mini-database. It was interesting to watch the index.txt file update automatically. It kept a running log of every certificate I issued, showing me that I wasn't just running commands, but managing a system that keeps track of its own state.
