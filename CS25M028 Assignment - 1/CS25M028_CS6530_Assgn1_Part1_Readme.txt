This submission contains the Python code for implementing Salsa20 and ChaCha20 as per Assignment 1.

# Contents:
1.  `CS25M028_Salsa20.py`: Source code for the Salsa20 cipher.
2.  `CS25M028_ChaCha20.py`: Source code for the ChaCha20 cipher.
3.  `main.py`: A script to execute the assignment tasks for both ciphers.
4.  `CS25M028_CS6530_Assgn1_Part1_Salsa20.txt`: Log output of the diffusion analysis for Salsa20.
5.  `CS25M028_CS6530_Assgn1_Part1_ChaCha20.txt`: Log output of the diffusion analysis for ChaCha20.

# How to Execute:
1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Place all files in the same directory.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
4.  Run the command: `python main.py`
5.  The script will automatically perform all tasks and generate the required output files, including encrypted/decrypted binaries. The `LOG_CORE_STATE` switch inside `main.py` can be toggled to enable or disable detailed state logging.
